# CommuneAI Developer Documentation


**Welcome!** 
Commune is a protocol that aims to connect all developer tools into one network, fostering a more shareable, reusable, and open economy. It follows an inclusive design philosophy that is based on being maximally unopinionated. This means that developers can leverage Commune as a versatile set of tools alongside their existing projects and have the freedom to incorporate additional tools they find valuable.

By embracing an unopinionated approach, Commune acknowledges the diverse needs and preferences of developers. It provides a flexible framework that allows developers to integrate specific tools seamlessly while avoiding imposing rigid structures or constraints. This adaptability enables developers to leverage Commune's capabilities in a manner that best aligns with their individual projects and workflows.

The overarching goal of Commune is to create a collaborative ecosystem where developers can easily share, connect, and extend their tools, ultimately fostering innovation and efficiency within the development community. By providing a network that encourages openness and accessibility, Commune empowers developers to leverage the collective knowledge and resources of the community to enhance their own projects.

## Start here

If you are new to Commune, start by learning the concepts. Then install the Commune software and create a wallet. Follow the below links. 

<Cards>
    <Card
    icon={MdInstallDesktop}
    title='Install'
    link='getting-started/installation'
    body='To validate or mine, or run your own subnet, install Commune and create wallet to get started.' />
    
</Cards>

:::tip How to participate
A straightforward way to participate in the Commune network is to be a subnet miner or a subnet validator in an existing subnet. It is not necessary to create a subnet. Follow the below links in the [Validate or mine](#validate-or-mine) section. Alternately, if you want to create your own custom incentive mechanism, then you create your own subnet and launch your own competition. See the below [Running a subnet](#running-a-subnet) section.
