### What is the roadmap of Commune?
</summary>
Commune is emerging in a decentralised manner, meaning it is formed by the contributions of many different independent people who commit code or try to convince the community to implement an idea. This makes the conventional concept of a roadmap unapplicable. However the goal for the community will always be to increase the prosperity of the protocol by improving its mechanisms and the value produced by miners and validators, while keeping it as fair and decentralized as possible. So at large we will likely always work towards that direction.
